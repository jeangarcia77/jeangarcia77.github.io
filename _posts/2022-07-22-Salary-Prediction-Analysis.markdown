<p class="intro"><span class="dropcap">As</span> a final project nearing the end of my Data Science bootcamp, we were tasked to find our very own dataset. In sourcing a viable dataset, we had to make sure it was something of interest to us and to our audience (pretend stakeholders). The idea was to determine whether a person makes less or equal to $50k or more a year. Taking many features into account; such as gender, education, age, etc. We will use old census data to predict whether a person falls into either category. While considering that the data in itself is older(1994) and that it does present an imbalance when it comes to gender. Let's dive right in!</p>

<blockquote>Above in the highlighted text we can see the main components to which I make use of in this analysis, essentially being the steps taken to get the necessary results. The project includes Supervised Learning and it is categorized as a classification problem. We'll preview some of the code needed to make my prediction but first let's go over some terminology that may not be too clear to our core audience.</blockquote>

More specifically, we will be defining what supervised learning and what classification means in order to allow understanding for all who view this post.

## Definition List
<dl>
  <dt>Supervised Learning is</dt>
  <dd><a href="https://www.ibm.com/cloud/blog/supervised-vs-unsupervised-learning">Internet</a>: A machine learning approach that’s defined by its use of labeled datasets. These datasets are designed to train or “supervise” algorithms into classifying data or predicting outcomes accurately. Using labeled inputs and outputs, the model can measure its accuracy and learn over time. <br><i>To note: Supervised Learning can be split into two subcategories; one being Classification(mentioned below) and the other Regression.</i></dd>
  <dt>Classification</dt>
  <dd>The simplest way to explain this is using the simplest classification task, the binary classification. The model makes a prediction between two classes, for example, a binary prediction might be yes or no. A very common classification task would predicting whether unseen emails are to be considered spam or not spam. <br>There are also multi-class classification tasks, such as predicting between three choices or more. <i>Our task is to determine whether a person makes less or equal to $50k or more a year.</i></dd>
