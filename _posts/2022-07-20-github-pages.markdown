<p class="intro"><span class="dropcap">C</span>reating a website these days is easier than ever, Github makes this free and readily available to anyone with an account.</p>

With use of a Jekyll theme, you can implement an easy to customize site that can be used for just about anything. Click here to find all the available <a href="https://jekyllthemes.io/free">free Jekyll</a> themes. After finding one that works best for your needs, we'll do the following to get your Jekyll theme installed with your very own Github username.

In the above image we can see an example of a free Jekyll theme. Upon clicking the Get Just the Docs on Github button, you'll be redirected to the owner's Github repository for the theme itself. The image below presents how to fork and install your theme by creating a new repository using your username. From this point on you will be working through Github to install and make any changes to the theme. In order to proceed we will need to click on the Fork button to the upper right hand corner of the page (example img below).

Once you have clicked the fork button, the Create a fork page will be brought up and allow for your entry of your username. To take advantage of the free hosting of your site, implement the following format in the Create a fork field. Example: jeangarcia77.github.io

This will only work when using your USERNAME in the field followed by a period then github period io as in my example above and the image below.
